<h2 align="center">Hi, I am Andreas 🌌</h2>


*“Not all those who wander are lost.”*

I am a data focused physicist with a background in astrophysics and strong experience in Python, SQL, and statistical data analysis.

My work involves processing and cleaning large scale datasets, building Python analysis pipelines, and applying Bayesian and classical statistical methods to real world data.

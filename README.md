<h2>Hi, I am Andreas</h2>

<p>
I am a data focused physicist with a background in astrophysics and strong experience in Python, SQL, and statistical data analysis.
</p>

<p>
My work involves processing and cleaning large scale datasets, building Python analysis pipelines, and applying Bayesian and classical statistical methods to real world data. I have worked extensively with noisy observational datasets and uncertainty analysis.

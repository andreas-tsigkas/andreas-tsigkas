## Hi, I am Andreas

I am a data focused physicist with a background in astrophysics and strong experience in Python, SQL, and statistical data analysis.

My work involves processing and cleaning large scale datasets, building Python analysis pipelines, and applying Bayesian and classical statistical methods to real world data. I have worked extensively with noisy observational datasets and uncertainty analysis.

### Skills
- Python data analysis with Pandas and NumPy
- SQL for data extraction and filtering
- Statistical modelling and Bayesian inference with PyMC
- Regression and classification methods
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Scientific computing with Matlab and Mathematica
- LaTeX

### Projects
- Bayesian analysis of Gaia astrometric data using Python and SQL
- Statistical modelling of large observational datasets in astrophysics

I am currently transitioning toward data science and applied machine learning roles.
